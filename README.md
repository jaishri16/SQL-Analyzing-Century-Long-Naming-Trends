This project utilizes SQL to extract valuable insights from baby name data. We explore a range of functionalities to answer various questions:

1. Unearthing Enduring Names: Identifying names consistently ranking among the top 5,000 for both genders across 1920-2020.
2. Classifying Name Popularity: Categorizing all names based on their frequency of appearance:
* Classic (appearing more than 80 times)
* Semi-classic (appearing 50 to 80 times)
* Semi-trendy (appearing 20 to 50 times)
* Trendy (appearing less than 20 times)
3. Top Female Names: Extracting the ten most popular female names in the US.
4. Personalized Name Search: Generating name recommendations based on user criteria (e.g., girls' names ending with "a" born after 2015).
5. Olivia's Rising Popularity: Determining the cumulative number of babies named Olivia throughout the data.
6. Year of Peak Popularity: Identifying the year when a specific male name saw the highest number of newborns assigned that name.
7. Most Popular Male Names by Year: Finding the most popular male name for each year along with the corresponding number of babies given that name.
8. Reigning Kings: Discovering male first names that have held the top spot in any year, along with the number of years each name held that position.

# Conclusion
This project showcases the versatility of SQL in analyzing baby name data. We can use SQL queries to identify timeless names, categorize names by popularity, explore trends across genders and years, and even create personalized name suggestions. Further exploration could involve investigating regional or ethnic name variations, analyzing name meaning correlations, or creating visualizations to depict trends graphically.
